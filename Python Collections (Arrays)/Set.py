# set

# Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

# Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

# Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True, 1, 2}
# print(thisset)
# output: {True, 2, 'cherry', 'apple', 'banana'}

# A set can contain different data types:
# set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
